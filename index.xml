      <description>Developing a backend application requires huge stability and data modeling is one of the pieces of software that is toughest to migrate hence choosing a reliable and stable technology is a necessity.
Spring Boot is one of the most reliable frameworks in the Java ecosystem. There are great efforts in developing leaner and better frameworks but Spring Boot seems to have great examples and solutions to many common problems faced in backend development.</description>

      <description>The most important thing when learning a new framework, especially ones which have a new way of doing things is to understand how to think (or design) solutions to a problem.
Next.js claims the major issue it fixes on top of React.js is &amp;ldquo;Pre Rendering&amp;rdquo;
What is Pre Rendering Historically frameworks like JSP used to render the HTML content of the page on the server-side and send the rendered HTML page to the browser.</description>

      <title>Code like you are coding in Erlang</title>

      <description>The most important part of coding I would consider would be abstraction. When designing in Java or other OOPs it is heavily considered to design your code base in such a way that there is proper abstraction or it could cause lot of issues. A single class should have a single responsibility and it should not allow other classes to mess with it. It should only provide the needed information also in a manner that the class could be changed with another implementation without any of the other classes knowing about this.</description>

      <description>This blog is aimed at people who haven’t heard of flutter and would like to take a shallow dive into it
Many of you already would have heard about this new Google’s framework. It was proposed and the beta was released a few weeks back. It is a framework in development. If you haven’t heard of it, then the next sentence I am going to tell will mostly make you close this post</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: The article is written based on intuitions and not data driven. It is based on the heuristics and biases at that time and hence It could be wrong. I would love to learn if there are any pitfalls in this article or any variables that I haven’t considered from you people in the comments
I recently came across a beautiful startup who make apps for end users. Their apps seem to be generating a good amount of downloads.</description>
