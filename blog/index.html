You can learn a language, with effort understand distributed systems, keep taking Andy Pavlo courses and reading DB books to get good with databases. As long as you have a decent social skill, you can learn (very happily) all the other skills needed to be a great engineer.
Moving to staff+ role? Having extreme ownership can get you a lot further along with you honing the technical skills.

Spring Boot is one of the most reliable frameworks in the Java ecosystem. There are great efforts in developing leaner and better frameworks but Spring Boot seems to have great examples and solutions to many common problems faced in backend development. But it is hard to overlook the aged development methodology and impact on productivity.

Next.js claims the major issue it fixes on top of React.js is “Pre Rendering”
What is Pre Rendering Historically frameworks like JSP used to render the HTML content of the page on the server-side and send the rendered HTML page to the browser. This is in contrast to the approach used in modern frameworks like React.js where the web page first loads the JS and then it renders all the required HTML elements on the client (read it as the browser) side

When designing in Java or other OOPs it is heavily considered to design your code base in such a way that there is proper abstraction or it could cause lot of issues. A single class should have a single responsibility and it should not allow other classes to mess with it. It should only provide the needed information also in a manner that the class could be changed with another implementation without any of the other classes knowing about this. The next important part would be for the developer to know at what STATE the program is. If the program has moved from STATE A to STATE B this should be because the developer wanted it to happen not because of some side effect. This exactly what happens when we allow mutation. There will be millions of states our program can enter into without our own knowledge. This will make it hard to track down bugs since we wont even know how it moved from one state to another (ReactJS with Redux solves this same problem where each of the state the application goes into is tracked)

Many of you already would have heard about this new Google’s framework. It was proposed and the beta was released a few weeks back. It is a framework in development. If you haven’t heard of it, then the next sentence I am going to tell will mostly make you close this post

I recently came across a beautiful startup who make apps for end users. Their apps seem to be generating a good amount of downloads. As I ventured deep into their customer feedback and revenue model. I figured they give apps to users at free of cost and after the app generates a good amount of users, they try to make certain features premium.
