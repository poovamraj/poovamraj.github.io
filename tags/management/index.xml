      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;traits-vs-skills&#34;&gt;Traits vs Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, most of the things you are going to work with will be skills. You can learn a language, with effort understand distributed systems, keep taking Andy Pavlo courses and reading DB books to get good with databases. As long as you have a decent social skill, you can learn (very happily) all the other skills needed to be a great engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to staff+ role? Having extreme ownership can get you a lot further along with you honing the technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
