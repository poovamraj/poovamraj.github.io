      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The article is written based on intuitions and not data driven. It is based on the heuristics and biases at that time and hence It could be wrong. I would love to learn if there are any pitfalls in this article or any variables that I haven’t considered from you people in the comments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a beautiful startup who make apps for end users. Their apps seem to be generating a good amount of downloads. As I ventured deep into their customer feedback and revenue model. I figured they give apps to users at free of cost and after the app generates a good amount of users, they try to make certain features premium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
